# Finding New Business Improvement Areas in Toronto with Machine Learning Applied Data Science Capstone Project

According to the city of Toronto, a Business Improvement Area (BIA) is an "association of commercial property owners and tenants within a defined area who work in partnership with the City to create thriving, competitive, and safe business areas that attract shoppers, diners, tourists, and new businesses". Business owners could benefit from a tool that would allow them to see if their area of interest has the potential of being approved as a BIA before starting the application process. The goal of this project is to leverage venue data to aid commercial property owners and tenants with the process of defining new BIA's based on the location and type of businesses in the city.
